**Course:** FAANG L4 System Design Interview Course Plan — V2  
**Session:** 17 / 46  
**Phase:** Fundamentals  
**Recommended time:** 60–90 minutes

## 1. Lesson Goal

This lesson builds one part of the vocabulary you will later combine in full system-design interviews.

By the end, you should be able to explain the core ideas without notes, apply them to a small backend scenario, identify important failure modes, and discuss at least one reasonable alternative.

### Core topics

- **Hash Ring Intuition** — explain what problem it solves, how it works conceptually, when to use it, and its trade-offs.
- **Virtual Nodes** — explain what problem it solves, how it works conceptually, when to use it, and its trade-offs.
- **Node Addition/Removal** — explain what problem it solves, how it works conceptually, when to use it, and its trade-offs.
- **Data Movement** — explain what problem it solves, how it works conceptually, when to use it, and its trade-offs.
- **Rebalancing** — explain what problem it solves, how it works conceptually, when to use it, and its trade-offs.
- **Distributed Cache Use** — explain what problem it solves, how it works conceptually, when to use it, and its trade-offs.
- **Partition Ownership** — explain what problem it solves, how it works conceptually, when to use it, and its trade-offs.
- **Skew** — explain what problem it solves, how it works conceptually, when to use it, and its trade-offs.
- **Limitations** — explain what problem it solves, how it works conceptually, when to use it, and its trade-offs.
- **When Simpler Hashing Is Enough** — explain what problem it solves, how it works conceptually, when to use it, and its trade-offs.

## 2. Why This Matters in an L4 Interview

At L4, naming a technology is not enough. Your answer should normally follow this reasoning chain:

```text
Requirement / workload
        ↓
Needed capability
        ↓
Design choice
        ↓
Trade-off
        ↓
Failure behavior
```

For this lesson, practice sentences such as:

> “Because the workload requires ___, I would use ___; the main trade-off is ___, and if it fails I would ___.”

The goal is not encyclopedic depth. It is dependable engineering judgment.

## 4. Worked Scenario

**Scenario:** Add one cache node to a cluster and compare ordinary modulo hashing with consistent hashing.

Work through it using this sequence:

```text
1. State the requirement.
2. Identify the relevant workload characteristic.
3. Apply today's concept.
4. Explain the simplest acceptable design.
5. Describe one failure mode.
6. Give one alternative and trade-off.
```

Write a short answer before reading further material.

### Example answer shape

```text
Requirement:
Workload:
Choice:
Why:
Failure mode:
Mitigation:
Alternative:
Trade-off:
```

Do not worry about creating a complete system architecture; this is a focused fundamentals drill.

## 5. Interview Reasoning Checklist

When today's concept appears in a future design, ask:

- What exact problem am I solving?
- Does the current scale actually require this?
- What is the source of truth/state owner?
- What happens under peak load or skew?
- What happens when this component becomes slow?
- What happens when it becomes unavailable?
- Is there stale, duplicated, reordered, or partially completed state?
- What operational signal would reveal trouble?
- What simpler alternative exists?

---

## 6. Small Drills

### Drill A — Explain Without Product Names

Explain today's topic without naming Redis, Kafka, Cassandra, Nginx, Kubernetes, or any other vendor/product unless the concept genuinely requires an example.

Your answer:

```text

```

### Drill B — Use vs Don't Use

Write one situation where today's technique is a good fit and one where it is unnecessary or harmful.

```text
Good fit:

Poor fit:
```

### Drill C — Failure Injection

Assume the component or mechanism introduced today becomes:

1. slow;
2. unavailable;
3. overloaded.

For each case, describe the user-visible impact and one mitigation.

### Drill D — 10× Growth

Ask:

> “If the workload becomes 10× larger, which assumption in today's design fails first?”

Write the answer in 3–5 sentences.

## 7. Knowledge Check

Answer without looking at notes.

1. What primary problem does **Consistent Hashing** solve?
2. Which workload characteristics make it useful?
3. What is one common misuse or overengineering mistake?
4. What is one important failure mode?
5. What is one operational metric or symptom you would watch?
6. What is one simpler alternative?
7. What is one scalability trade-off?
8. What is one correctness or consistency concern?
9. How would you explain this concept in under one minute?
10. How might it appear in a real system design such as chat, feed, storage, or booking?

### Suggested scoring

- **8–10:** ready to move on.
- **6–7:** review weak concepts, then explain aloud again.
- **0–5:** repeat the core material before moving forward.

---

## 8. Spoken Exercise

Without notes, explain today's lesson for **3–5 minutes**.

Your explanation should include:

```text
Problem
How it works
When to use it
When not to use it
Failure mode
Trade-off
Example
```

If you cannot do this clearly, the session is not complete.
